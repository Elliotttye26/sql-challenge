### sql-challenge

##This Challenge is divided into three parts: data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis.
#data modeling
The ERD was useful when thinking about building the tables and creating the query code. It provides an easy to read breakdown of what the CSV files have an how the columns are named for a quick reference. In addition, seeing the connections between files was imperitive to creating the code for each query. It increased visibility on how to merge, where to merge and what files could be included with other files.

#data engineering
Maybe the most tricky portion of this challenge is the engineering. Creating the tables with correct keys can be confusing and tricky to follow. Uploading the CSV's proved one of the biggest challenges in making sure they headers lined up and the columns were acceptable to the tables that were created.

#data analysis
The challenge here is learning syntax errors and the format that SQL requires in delivering your code into queries.

List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
